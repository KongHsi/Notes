Reasons to analyze algorithms: Performance with guarantees
  A good algorithm reduces time costs by Brute force solution
  
Scientific framework for performance analysis and algorithms comparison:
  Observe
  Hypothesize
  Predict
  Verify
  Validate (until the hypothesis and observations agree)
  
  Pinciples: 
    Experiments must be REPRODUCIBLE
    Hypothesis must be FALSIFIABLE
    
Observations:
  Measuring the running time
  In Java public class Stopwatch (part of stdlib.jar)
    Stopwatch stopwatch = new Stopwatch()
    ...
    double t = stopwatch.elapsedTime()
