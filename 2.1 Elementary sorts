Goal is to sort any type of data.

Total order is a binary relation <= that satisfies:
  Antisymmetry: v<=w and w<=v, then v = w
  Transitivity: if v<=w and w<=x, then v<=x
  Totality: either v<=w or w<=v or both
  
compareTo() is a total order, returns either 0, +n or -n.



Selection sort: go over the list and find the min/max element
  Average Needs to compare (N-1) + (N-2) + ... + 1 + 0 ~ N^2/2 and N exchanges

Insertion sort: go over the list and move a[i] to the left of each larger entry
  Average Needs 1/4N^2 exchanges and compares
  
Shell sort:
